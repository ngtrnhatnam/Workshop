> **Goal**: Quickly set up an AI model on AWS SageMaker, ready to integrate into your serverless image recognition application.

---

## Introduction

In this section, we will **quickly create SageMaker AI** to support real-time image recognition.  
The process includes:

- Creating a **SageMaker Studio** for development.
- Configuring an **IAM Role** so SageMaker can access S3, Lambda, and other related AWS services.
- Uploading a pre-trained model to get it ready for deployment.
