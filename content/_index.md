# 🏁Workshop: Deploying a Real-Time Image Recognition Serverless Application with Lambda and SageMaker  🚀

Welcome to **Workshop: Deploying a Real-Time Image Recognition Serverless Application with Lambda and SageMaker!**. This is a **6-hour** hands-on training program that helps you build a **serverless web application** for real-time image recognition using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. By leveraging services such as **S3, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB,** and **SageMaker**, you will learn how to deploy a complete system — from static front-end to backend — with automated backup and performance monitoring.
