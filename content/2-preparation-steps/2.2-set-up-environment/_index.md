> **Goal**: Fork & clone the project, create a virtual environment, and install required Python libraries to run the application.

---

## 1. Fork and Clone the Project

- Go to the GitHub repo:  
  [https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo](https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo)
- Click **Fork** to create a copy under your own GitHub account.
- Clone it to your machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Serverless-ML-Inference-with-Lambda-and-SageMaker.git
cd <your-repo>
code .
```

---

## 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

- Create Virtual Environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

- And then activate it:
  - Windows:
  ```bash
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

  - macOS / Linux:
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```
> If successful, youâ€™ll see the environment name (e.g., *.venv*) at the beginning of the terminal line.

*HÃ¬nh 1: Check the virtual environment if it activated.*

## 3. Install Required Libraries

- Quick install these required libraries:  
```bash
pip install boto3 sagemaker torch torchvision pillow
```
> Note:
> - If you plan to train models locally, ensure gcc or the corresponding build tools are installed for your OS.
> - torch installation might take a few minutes depending on your internet speed.
